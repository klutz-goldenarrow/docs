We call them script mods . How it works \u00b6 .dll asset is treated by the game as any other mod asset, so as you placed it in your mod folder, the game will found and load it. However, the process of creating the DLL file itself differs greatly from the other assets. Core concepts \u00b6 The DLL file you want to get in the end essentially is a .NET class library targeting .NET Standart 2.0 (or .NET 4.x) and containing one or more implementations of the IMod interface provided by Voxel Tycoon API. In order to access Voxel Tycoon and Unity APIs you need to reference Assembly-CSharp.dll and UnityEngine.CoreModule.dll libraries that can be found in VoxelTycoon_Data/Managed directory inside the game folder. Also, you might want to reference UnityEngine.UI.dll if you want to work with the game UI. After you compile your library, the resulted .dll file is ready to be put into your mod directory and loaded by the game. Step-by-step tutorial \u00b6 In order to help you start working with the concepts described above, we compiled a simple step-by-step tutorial which will guide you through the process of creating your first script mod for Voxel Tycoon. FAQ \u00b6 What can be done with the script mods? \u00b6 Voxel Tycoon works on top of Unity, and script mods have full access to all the features that Unity runtime provides, as well as Voxel Tycoon APIs. In other words, you can do anything that you can normally do with Unity runtime at least. In what language mods can be written? \u00b6 Since the game is written in C# and works on top of Unity (which primary language is also C#), most examples, tutorials, and docs you may find will use this language. That being said, C# recommended language of choice for the script mods . C# is a modern, constantly evolving language that provides a huge variety of features and flexibility. However, any .NET language will work. Where's API documentation? \u00b6 There are almost no documented APIs available currently in Voxel Tycoon. Still, we urge you to start creating script mods right now , so we can build an extendable, flexible, and well-featured platform together with you. Just as you feel that you need any new APIs, events, callbacks, etc - or modifications of existing ones - do not hesitate to let us know by creating an issue on suggestion tracker . Also, feel free to chat with us and community directly on our Discord Server . We are committed to update and extend the modding APIs along with your requests as soon as possible. Meanwhile, we suggest you to use decompilers such as dnSpy to dig into the game's code and start exploring the possibilities for modification. Also, we've hosted a repository with the source code of our official mods and samples.","title":".dll asset"},{"location":"assets/dll-asset/#dll-asset","text":"","title":".dll asset"},{"location":"assets/dll-asset/#description","text":"Since 0.79 you can create not only content-based mods but also mods that provide new behaviors and logic, or modify already existent ones.

How it works \u00b6 Every .patch asset consists of a list of commands . Each command defines which operation should be applied to what asset, and also specifies arguments specific to that command. An example patch that adds custom made peyotes to the desert biome from the base game: { \"Commands\" : [ { \"Command\" : \"Add\" , \"TargetAssetUri\" : \"base/desert.biome\" , \"Path\" : \"Plants\" , \"Values\" : [ { \"Uri\" : \"plants-o-plenty/peyote.plant\" , \"Probability\" : 0.02 } ] } ] } Available commands \u00b6 Add \u00b6 Adds provided values to a collection at the path. Argument Description TargetAssetUri : string The URI of the target asset. Path : string JsonPath to a collection (or collections) where values should be added. Values : array Values to add. Set \u00b6 Sets provided value to a property at the path. Argument Description TargetAssetUri : string The URI of the target asset. Path : string JsonPath to a property (or properties) which value should be set. Value : any Value to be set. Remove \u00b6 Removes value at the path. Argument Description TargetAssetUri : string The URI of the target asset. Path : string JsonPath to a value (or values) which should be removed. Merge \u00b6 Merges provided object with an object at the path (as described here ). Argument Description TargetAssetUri : string The URI of the target asset. Path : string JsonPath to an object (or objects) where provided object should be merged. Value : object Object to be merged. ArrayHandling : string One of the values described here . Optional (default: \"Concat\" ) NullValueHandling : string One of the values described here . Optional (default: \"Merge\" ) Optional flag \u00b6 Sometimes, you might want to alter assets which presence is not known in advance. Luckily, since 0.78 , each command supports the new Optional flag. When set to true , in case the target asset was not found, a command will be just skipped without failing. Debugging \u00b6 You can actually see how target assets look after all patches are applied to them. To do so, open the Settings window while holding SHIFT , then navigate to Misc tab and toggle Write patched assets setting (at the bottom). Now, every time you load or start a new game with your mod enabled, the game will write target assets in their final form (with all patches applied) to <original_filename>.patched.json . Don't forget to remove those files before publishing your mod, and disable this option after debugging is completed to avoid the additional performance cost.","title":".patch asset"},{"location":"assets/patch-asset/#patch-asset","text":"","title":".patch asset"},{"location":"assets/patch-asset/#description","text":"This type of asset allows you to apply changes to assets located in any other mod, including the base game content.","title":"Description"},{"location":"assets/patch-asset/#how-it-works","text":"Every .patch asset consists of a list of commands .

Steam locomotives and some diesel locomotives use rods to be able to move the wheels. In VT it's necessary to specify the position and rotation of each of rod so the game can animate them. This section within the .trainunit asset defines the different loops of the locomotive rods and the positions and rotations in the eight frames that each animation has. It's important to mention the starting position and mesh origin for each piece: Coupling Rod shares the locomotives mesh origin. Main Rod and Piston Rod share the same origin; the pivot point where the Piston Rod and Main Rod are connected (aka Crosshead Wristpin). We always start with the Piston Rod in the centre of it's travel, and the Coupling Rod centred in either the lowest point in rotation (as shown in the images below). This will dictate the correct length for the Main Rod. \"Submeshes\" : [ { \"MeshUri\" : \"mezcorp/c30_cr.obj\" , // Coupling Rod \"DefaultAnimation\" : { \"PositionY\" : { \"0\" : 0.0 , \"0.125\" : 0.028619 , \"0.25\" : 0.097699 , \"0.375\" : 0.168753 , \"0.5\" : 0.196385 , \"0.625\" : 0.168753 , \"0.75\" : 0.097699 , \"0.875\" : 0.028619 , \"1\" : 0.0 }, \"PositionZ\" : { \"0\" : 0.0 , \"0.125\" : -0.070067 , \"0.25\" : -0.0976 , \"0.375\" : -0.068981 , \"0.5\" : 0.0 , \"0.625\" : 0.068981 , \"0.75\" : 0.0976 , \"0.875\" : 0.070067 , \"1\" : 0.0 } } }, { \"MeshUri\" : \"mezcorp/c30_mr.obj\" , // Main Rod \"DefaultAnimation\" : { \"PositionY\" : { \"0\" : 0.229511 }, \"PositionZ\" : { \"0\" : 0.744807 , \"0.125\" : 0.67474 , \"0.25\" : 0.652042 , \"0.375\" : 0.684608 , \"0.5\" : 0.747767 , \"0.625\" : 0.823755 , \"0.75\" : 0.851387 , \"0.875\" : 0.817834 , \"1\" : 0.744807 }, \"RotationX\" : { \"0\" : 0 , \"0.125\" : 2.28828 , \"0.25\" : 7.63773 , \"0.375\" : 13.2599 , \"0.5\" : 15.4827 , \"0.625\" : 13.2599 , \"0.75\" : 7.63773 , \"0.875\" : 2.28828 , \"1\" : 0 } } }, { \"MeshUri\" : \"mezcorp/c30_pr.obj\" , // Piston Rod \"DefaultAnimation\" : { \"PositionY\" : { \"0\" : 0.229511 }, \"PositionZ\" : { \"0\" : 0.744807 , \"0.125\" : 0.67474 , \"0.25\" : 0.652042 , \"0.375\" : 0.684608 , \"0.5\" : 0.747767 , \"0.625\" : 0.823755 , \"0.75\" : 0.851387 , \"0.875\" : 0.817834 , \"1\" : 0.744807 }, } } ] MeshUri : Path of the file that contains the mesh of the rod.

Each animation is made up of eight frames ranging from 0 to 1. Each frame rotates the wheels 45 degrees clockwise. We will start animating the coupling rod. The first thing is to turn the central wheel clockwise 45 degrees by rotating on the X-axis, and then move the coupling rod to coincide with the point of attachment of the wheel. Once we have the rod in position, we must write down the positions on the Y-axis and Z-axis, which are the values that we have to enter in the second frame of the animation of the coupling rod in the .trainunit asset. The axes can change according to the 3d modeling program we are using, but the positions will always be the same. Also, see that position Z has the a negative symbol in the .trainunit asset. We will keep moving the coupling rod in the same way until we reach the fifth frame that represents half of the animation, where we just need to change the sign of the remaining frames on the Z-axis and repeat the values of the Y-axis frames. The piston rod is the easiest animation since the position on the Y-axis does not vary and only moves along the Z-axis. Also, the position on the Z-axis coincides with the position of the main rod on the same axis. For the main rod, we must do the same as with the coupling rod; we move it until the end coincides with the point of union with the coupling rod. When we have finished the animation, we must put the rods in position 0,0,0 , now and we can export them.","title":"Animating locomotive rods"},{"location":"guides/content-mods/animating-locomotive-rods/#animating-locomotive-rods","text":"Info This guide is authored by Voxel Tycoon community member scailman .

The piston rod is the easiest animation since the position on the Y-axis does not vary and only moves along the Z-axis. Also, the position on the Z-axis coincides with the position of the main rod on the same axis. For the main rod, we must do the same as with the coupling rod; we move it until the end coincides with the point of union with the coupling rod. When we have finished the animation, we must put the rods in position 0,0,0 , now and we can export them.","title":"Animating locomotive rods"},{"location":"guides/content-mods/creating-a-small-production-chain/","text":"Creating a small production chain \u00b6 Info This guide is authored by Voxel Tycoon community member scailman . Introduction \u00b6 In this guide you will learn how to create a new industry and all the elements that make it up. It's not a complex task but it's necessary to take into account many elements that are related to each other. Since we've explained how to create vehicles and trains in other guides, the process for their creation will not be repeated in this guide. A production chain can be very simple, using products and buildings that already exist in the base game, or have a very high degree of complexity, it all depends on our imagination. The best thing before starting to create items, buildings and vehicles, is to have an idea of what we want to do and create a small diagram of all the elements that our production chain needs. This is highly recommended since on many occasions we will have to link buildings with items or vehicles and problems may come up when we forget to correctly configure something in an asset. A production chain is made up of several steps, ore deposits, mining buildings, product processing building, warehouses and stores. All the buildings interact with each other and each one has a different extraction and production time, so adjustments must be made to have a balanced production in the different phases. Raw material deposits ( .depositrecipe asset) \u00b6 Deposits of raw materials are the beginning of the production chain and are scattered throughout the regions. They are the main source of resources. As a finite amount of resources, they will become depleted when fully mined and will no longer be possible to extract. { \"ItemUri\" : \"scm_oil_industry/crude.item\" , \"TintColor\" : \"353535\" , \"RadiusMultiplier\" : 0.5 , \"CapacityMultiplier\" : null , \"DecorationUris\" : [], \"Tier\" : 0 } ItemUri : Path of the item asset that will be extracted from the deposit.

By default the value is null . Values above 1 increase size and below decrease it. CapacityMultiplier : Amount of resources that can be extracted from the deposit. The default value is null . DecorationUris (Array): Deposits can have decorations like trees in forests. It's a list of all the paths of the asset files that will be shown as decoration on the deposit. \"DecorationUris\" : [ \"base/spruce.plant\" ] Tier : Deposit level. Deposits at tier 0 are included in the first available region when a new map is created. Higher tiers are available at a further distance. E.g. Coal, Iron Ore and Wood are tier 0, but Copper, Sand and Stone are tier 1. Extracting resources ( .mine asset ) \u00b6 Mines or any other type of building that allows the extraction of raw resources are special buildings that must be placed whithin the area of the deposit. They can only be placed in the resource that it can extract, for example you can't place an iron mine in a coal deposit. Mines can have animated submeshes like steam locomotives and sound and smoke for when they're active. { \"OutputInterval\" : 5.5 , \"Submeshes\" : [ { \"MeshUri\" : \"scm_oil_industry/main_arm.obj\" , \"DefaultAnimation\" : { \"PositionY\" : { \"0\" : 1.92 }, \"PositionZ\" : { \"0\" : 0.176 // y -0 , 176 }, \"RotationX\" : { \"0\" : 0.0 , \"0.125\" : -6.12 , \"0.25\" : -18.682 , \"0.375\" : -29.730 , \"0.5\" : -34.724 , \"0.625\" : -33.659 , \"0.75\" : -20.718 , \"0.875\" : -6.333 , \"1\" : 0.0 } } }, { \"MeshUri\" : \"scm_oil_industry/rod.obj\" , \"DefaultAnimation\" : { \"PositionY\" : { \"0\" : 1.069 , \"0.125\" : 0.991 , \"0.25\" : 0.802 , \"0.375\" : 0.613 , \"0.5\" : 0.534 , \"0.625\" : 0.613 , \"0.75\" : 0.802 , \"0.875\" : 0.991 , \"1\" : 1.069 }, \"PositionZ\" : { \"0\" : -0.738 , \"0.125\" : -0.549 , \"0.25\" : -0.47 , \"0.375\" : -0.549 , \"0.5\" : -0.737 , \"0.625\" : -0.926 , \"0.75\" : -1.005 , \"0.875\" : -0.926 , \"1\" : -0.738 }, \"RotationX\" : { \"0\" : 0.0 , \"0.125\" : -12.104 , \"0.25\" : -15.204 , \"0.375\" : -6.296 , \"0.5\" : 8.13 , \"0.625\" : 20.407 , \"0.75\" : 20.007 , \"0.875\" : 12.128 , \"1\" : 0.0 } } }, { \"MeshUri\" : \"scm_oil_industry/rotor.obj\" , \"DefaultAnimation\" : { \"PositionY\" : { \"0\" : 0.801 }, \"PositionZ\" : { \"0\" : -0.738 }, \"RotationX\" : { \"0\" : 0.0 , \"0.125\" : 45 , \"0.25\" : 90 , \"0.375\" : 135 , \"0.5\" : 180 , \"0.625\" : 225 , \"0.75\" : 270 , \"0.875\" : 315 , \"1\" : 360 } } } ], \"Sounds\" : null , \"Smokes\" : null , \"ResearchUri\" : \"scm_oil_industry/oil_extraction.research\" , \"Size\" : { \"X\" : 2 , \"Y\" : 3 , \"Z\" : 3 }, \"Liveries\" : { \"default\" : { \"MeshUri\" : \"scm_oil_industry/crude_pump.obj\" , \"MeshVariant\" : null , \"Lights\" : null } }, \"Price\" : 53000.0 , \"RunningCosts\" : null , \"Hidden\" : false } OutputInterval : The time in seconds it takes to generate one unit.

These buildings require materials to produce the products that will be supplied to the stores. Unlike the other buildings, these have input and output conveyor to supply raw materials or other required items. The entrances and exits can be placed on any of the four facades of the building and don't have an established directionality, that is, if the building requires one item to produce another and has one entrance and one exit, it doesn't matter the direction of the conveyor. { \"RecipeTargetUri\" : \"scm_oil_industry/refinery.recipetarget\" , \"Submeshes\" : [], \"Sounds\" : [ { \"SoundUri\" : \"scm_oil_industry/refinery_device.wav\" , \"Time\" : 0.5 } ], \"Smokes\" : [ { \"Uri\" : \"scm_oil_industry/refinery_device.smoke\" , \"Position\" : [ -1.583 , 5.4 , 1.305 ] } ], \"ClippingPlanes\" : null , \"Conveyors\" : [ { \"SpawnConnection\" : 1 , \"Uri\" : \"base/regular.conveyor\" , \"ConveyorType\" : \"StraightShort\" , \"Position\" : { \"X\" : 0 , \"Y\" : 0 , \"Z\" : 4 }, \"Rotation\" : \"Rotate90\" , \"Handle\" : false }, { \"SpawnConnection\" : null , \"Uri\" : \"base/regular.conveyor\" , \"ConveyorType\" : \"Cap\" , \"Position\" : { \"X\" : -1 , \"Y\" : 0 , \"Z\" : 4 }, \"Rotation\" : \"Rotate90\" , \"Handle\" : true }, { \"SpawnConnection\" : 1 , \"Uri\" : \"base/regular.conveyor\" , \"ConveyorType\" : \"StraightShort\" , \"Position\" : { \"X\" : 0 , \"Y\" : 0 , \"Z\" : 5 }, \"Rotation\" : \"Rotate90\" , \"Handle\" : false }, { \"SpawnConnection\" : null , \"Uri\" : \"base/regular.conveyor\" , \"ConveyorType\" : \"Cap\" , \"Position\" : { \"X\" : -1 , \"Y\" : 0 , \"Z\" : 5 }, \"Rotation\" : \"Rotate90\" , \"Handle\" : true } ], \"ResearchUri\" : \"scm_oil_industry/oil_extraction.research\" , \"Size\" : { \"X\" : 7 , \"Y\" : 6 , \"Z\" : 8 }, \"Liveries\" : { \"default\" : { \"MeshUri\" : \"scm_oil_industry/refinery_device.obj\" , \"MeshVariant\" : null , \"Lights\" : null } }, \"Price\" : 45500.0 , \"RunningCosts\" : null , \"Hidden\" : false } RecipeTargetUri : The asset responsible for the building to accept recipes.

ClippingPlanes : This is a plane that allows to darken an area of the building. An example is the plane used in train depots. Conveyors (Array): This section defines the conveyor belt as well as its position, orientation and type. An industry can have as many conveyor belts as desired and they don't all have to be on the same building facade. In this conveyor placement example, the building has a size of 6x8. In the right diagram, the light gray area represents the building. The coordinates (0,0) are always in the upper right corner of the building and the positive values go from right to left and from top to bottom. Values will be negative if they are above or to the right of the coordinates (0,0). The code shown above represent an industry that have two conveyor (orange area in the diagram) that start at positions (0,4) and (0,5) respectively and have a rotation of 90 degrees. The rotation of the conveyors goes counterclockwise and starts at 0 degrees at the bottom of the building. SpawnConnection : Specifies the connection of the conveyor where items will spawn.

Hidden : Indicates whether or not the building appears in the mine construction menu. By default the value is false. Stores ( .house asset ): \u00b6 Stores are the end of the production chain and demand products that are paid depending on supply and demand. With town or city growth, stores from time to time will increase in level and the quantity of products they demand. If demand is low and too much cargo is delivered, prices will drop and if demand is very high but we do not cover it, prices will rise but there is a risk that the business will go bankrupt and close. { \"PopulationRange\" : [ 1 , 1 ], \"CanHaveDemand\" : true , \"Size\" : { \"X\" : 7 , \"Y\" : 2 , \"Z\" : 5 }, \"Liveries\" : { \"default\" : { \"MeshUri\" : \"scm_oil_industry/gas_station.obj\" , \"MeshVariant\" : null , \"Lights\" : null }, \"default_night_1\" : { \"MeshUri\" : \"scm_oil_industry/gas_station.obj\" , \"MeshVariant\" : \"night_1\" , \"Lights\" : null } }, \"Price\" : 33000.0 , \"RunningCosts\" : null , \"Hidden\" : false } PopulationRange : Specifies the population range that the building provides to the city when the city generates the store. It shows the minimum and maximum value of the population that it can have. CanHaveDemand : Specifies if the building can demand products. Size : Building size in X, Y, Z axes.

As it is a city building, it has no effect on the player's finances. It is null value iby default. Hidden : This parameter indicates whether the object will appear in the game or in menus as buildable asset in the player's menu. Hidden assets can still be visible in game, e.g. locomotives in recipes. Selling products ( .citydemandrecipe asset ): \u00b6 This asset allows city stores to request a demand for products. { \"ParentUri\" : null , \"BuildingUri\" : \"scm_oil_industry/gas_station.house\" , \"ItemUri\" : \"scm_oil_industry/diesel.item\" , \"Tier\" : 2 , \"Demand\" : null , \"DemandMultiplier\" : 2.0 , \"Price\" : null , \"PriceMultiplier\" : null } ParentUri : Path of the .citydemandrecipe asset if the demanded product requires other. For example, advanced wood frames require wood frames. BuildingUri : Path to the store's .house asset. ItemUri : Path of the .item asset of the product you are requesting. Tier : Store level is required to request the product. As with tiers of deposits, a tier 0 will appear at a starting point in the game with no research. A tier 1 will only appear after a tier 0 is receives demand within a town/city, and so on with each tier. If a tier 1 is active in a town/city, no new tier 0 stores will appear. Demand : Quantity of product demand. By default the value is null . DemandMultiplier : Multiplier of demand for the product. By default the value is null . Price : Price paid for one unit of product. If the value is null the game will calculate the price depending on the inflation. PriceMultiplier : Price multiplier. Researching the new industry ( .research asset ): \u00b6 Like other types of buildings in the game, industries can be researched to make them available in the game. Researches may requiere a quantity of money or a number of items that must be delivered to the laboratories, some researches only become unlocked after previous reserch. { \"ParentResearchUris\" : [ \"base/research_and_development.research\" ], \"Tier\" : 2 , \"Days\" : 100 , \"DaysMultiplier\" : null , \"PricePerDay\" : null , \"PricePerDayMultiplier\" : null , \"ItemsPerDay\" : [ { \"Uri\" : \"base/iron_bar.item\" , \"Count\" : null , \"CountMultiplier\" : null } ], \"CompletedByDefault\" : false , \"Hidden\" : false , \"Goal\" : false } ParentResearchUris (Array): This is a list with the paths of all the .research assets of the research on which it depends.

Introduction \u00b6 This guide tries to show the basic steps to create a mod that adds new buildings in the city generation in Voxel Tycoon (as per v0.80 ). The guide is not intended to teach you modeling, so you must have a basic understanding of 3DS Max, Blender, Wings 3D, or any other program you want to use that allows you to import and export .obj files. Modeling suggestions \u00b6 As in all games, there are certain recommendations that must be followed when creating a 3d model. The 3d model should not exceed 1500 triangles to avoid overloading the game in case we are going to create a building that will appear many times in cities. The size of the building should not exceed 5x5x10m. The model must have the minimum details that make it recognizable but without overloading the model. The colors have to be pastel colors so that match the same style as the rest of the buildings in the game. Use dark tones for windows. I recommend the value #272727 (RGB 39,39,39) . Basic concepts when modeling a building \u00b6 When starting the creation of a building, it is a good idea to think about what type of building we want to represent and what size it will have. A good recommendation is to import a building similar to the base game buildings on the size of our model. A good practice is to start with a grid with the size of the building we want to make. See the following image. Each grid represents a 1x1 meter that matches a voxel in the game. Taking these dimensions into account, we know that the building must not exceed these limits when creating it. The building can have as many parts as it can be, but when we export it to the game, it is recommended that there be only one single object that conforms to the entire building. The coordinate axis must be located at 0,0,0 , although then the building is not centered with respect to the plane that we have used as a reference to define the size. This must be taken into account so that the building does not overlap with the roads or other buildings. The position of the main facade is important so that once the building is already in the game, it appears correctly located next to the roads and as a reference to the dimensions of the base of the building that we will have to configure later. In this case, the X-axis is the main facade of the building and measures 6m and the Z-axis is the bottom of the building and measures 4m. The axis orientation may vary depending on the 3d program being used, which in this case is 3ds max. Texturing the building \u00b6 VT texturing is very basic, it uses a 64x64 pixel square texture divided into different squares in which each unit will represent a color when the building is exported. This base texture can be found in the folder `Content/your_first_pack\" where the game is installed. Once this texture has been applied to the model, we can start creating the unwrap separating all the polygons of the model depending on the color that we want them to have once it is finished. This is how the building unwrap should look depending on the number of colors we are going to use. For the night effect of the windows, in case the building has windows, the windows must be separated in different colors in the unwrap since they will be the different variations of windows lit at night. In the previous image, the unwrap has been created so that the building has three variations of night windows. Later we will explain how to create the necessary settings so that the windows appear lit at night. Building export \u00b6 Once we have the finished model, we can always export it to the game in .obj format. For now, it is only a simple 3d model but later we will configure the necessary files so that the game recognizes it and can generate our building in the cities. All mods must be contained in the folder Content/<mod_name> . For convenience and order, it's recommended to follow the same directory structure that the game uses and that can be verified by opening the folder Content/base . Building settings ( .house asset) \u00b6 In order for the game to recognize that we have created a building, we must create or copy the .house file of any existing building and modify the necessary parameters. This file is located in the folder Content/base/houses . To edit the game files we only need a text editor such as Notepad ++, or Visual Studio Code. I highly recommend VS Code as you can compare side by side. { \"PopulationRange\" : [ 8 , 12 ], \"CanHaveDemand\" : false , \"Size\" : { \"X\" : 6 , \"Y\" : 4 , \"Z\" : 4 }, \"Liveries\" : { \"default\" : { \"MeshUri\" : \"arab_buildings/arab_house5_desert.obj\" , \"MeshVariant\" : null , \"Lights\" : null }, \"default_night_1\" : { \"MeshUri\" : \"arab_buildings/arab_house5_desert.obj\" , \"MeshVariant\" : \"night_1\" , \"Lights\" : null }, \"default_night_2\" : { \"MeshUri\" : \"arab_buildings/arab_house5_desert.obj\" , \"MeshVariant\" : \"night_2\" , \"Lights\" : null }, \"default_night_3\" : { \"MeshUri\" : \"arab_buildings/arab_house5_desert.obj\" , \"MeshVariant\" : \"night_3\" , \"Lights\" : null } }, \"Price\" : 8800.0 , \"RunningCosts\" : null , \"Hidden\" : false } This is what the .house asset file looks like and contains the following parameters: PopulationRange : Indicates the maximum and minimum population that the building will have when the city generates it. CanHaveDemand ( true / false ): This parameter indicates if it can request a product, as is the case in stores. In the rest of the buildings, the value is false. Size : Specifies the size of the building. These are the values we use in the reference plane. For the value of Y, the height, we must always round up, for example, if our building measures 2.4m (2.4 voxels) we must always indicate a value of 3. Liveries : In this parameter, the path of the mesh of our building that we exported previously is indicated. Note that the first part of MeshUri (arab_buildinhgs), is the name of our mod followed by the name of the .obj file. default_night_1(..3) : is the name of the different liveries to show the windows lit at night. There are three liveries that match the unwrap of the model. MeshVariant : Indicates the name of the variant specified in the .obj.meta file that defines the colors of the model that we will explain later. Price : It is the price of the building, in this case, the demolition price. RunningCosts : It is the operating cost of the building. As it is a city building, it has no effect on the player's finances. A null value indicates that loc automatically calculates the game. Hidden ( true / false ); This parameter indicates whether the object will appear in the game or in menus as a buildable asset in the player's menu. Hide assets are still visible in-game, eg. locomotives in recipes. Building settings ( .citybuildingspawninfo asset) \u00b6 This file tells the game how our building should generate when a city grows. { \"Uri\" : \"arab_buildings/arab_house5.house\" , \"ProportionalCount\" : 50 , \"Density\" : 0.0 , \"Biomes\" : [ \"arab_buildings/desert2.biome\" ] } Uri : It is the path of the .house file that we explained previously. ProportionalCount : It is the proportion in which the building will appear with respect to the total number of buildings in the city. Density : Density of buildings in the city of this type. Biomes : This parameter indicates in which specific biome the building should appear. If the value is \"null\", the building will appear in all biomes, but if a biome is specified, the building will only appear in that biome as the buildings in the Arctic biome. Asset Editor \u00b6 The asset editor integrated into the game and accessible from the main menu, allows us to modify the colors of any asset in the game. In it, we will look for the building that we have created. The first time we access our building it will appear in gray color. This means you don't have a color palette assigned yet. To create a color palette we must click on Generate Palette and the model will now have the colors of the reference image that we used when creating the unwrap. To assign colors, we simply have to click on the different parts of the building that will be highlighted as we move the mouse over it and select a color in the window that appears on the right. To specify a specific color that we already have defined, you can enter the hexadecimal value of the color. The different bars that appear below the color picker allow you to add brightness to the material or not to be affected by light at night, making it have the effect of lighting. Once we have finished applying the colors, the building will look like this. The different colors of the palette are saved in the .obj.meta file and contain the different variants that indicate what color and properties should be replaced for the effect of illuminated windows. { \"Materials\" : [ // ...skipping a few colors here to to simplify the example... { \"Color\" : \"ffde9f\" , \"Glassiness\" : 0.0 , \"Specular\" : 0.0 , \"Smoothness\" : 0.0 , \"Emission\" : 0.0 }, { \"Color\" : \"a78466\" , \"Glassiness\" : 0.0 , \"Specular\" : 0.0 , \"Smoothness\" : 0.0 , \"Emission\" : 0.0 }, { \"Color\" : \"c0c199\" , \"Glassiness\" : 0.0 , \"Specular\" : 0.0 , \"Smoothness\" : 0.0 , \"Emission\" : 0.0 }, { \"Color\" : \"6a5341\" , \"Glassiness\" : 0.0 , \"Specular\" : 0.0 , \"Smoothness\" : 0.0 , \"Emission\" : 0.0 } ], \"Variants\" : { \"night_1\" : { \"8\" : { \"Color\" : \"aa9d68\" , \"Glassiness\" : 0.0 , \"Specular\" : 0.0 , \"Smoothness\" : 0.0 , \"Emission\" : 1.0 } }, \"night_2\" : { \"9\" : { \"Color\" : \"aa9d68\" , \"Glassiness\" : 0.0 , \"Specular\" : 0.0 , \"Smoothness\" : 0.0 , \"Emission\" : 1.0 } }, \"night_3\" : { \"10\" : { \"Color\" : \"aa9d68\" , \"Glassiness\" : 0.0 , \"Specular\" : 0.0 , \"Smoothness\" : 0.0 , \"Emission\" : 1.0 } } } } The code above shows the color palette of the example building. We skipped some colors at the beginning because the listing would be too large but you can see the section of the variants. In the variants section, the names of the three variants are defined for the night windows that appeared in the .house file named night_1 - 3 . In this case, the values 8, 9, 10 correspond to the colors in the upper section which are the ones to be replaced by the colors and parameters of the Variants section. To know what values you have to specify, the colors range from 0 to 15 (16 in total) but the easy way to find the correct colors is by the hexadecimal value. If color #272727 was used, all colors with this value represent windows. Another parameter that can identify the windows in the Glossiness parameter, which in the rest of the colors will be 0.0 . Localization ( .strings asset) \u00b6 The location file allows indicating the name that will be shown in the menus or in the new information tool (pre-alpha 0.80) of the building. { \"LocaleUri\" : \"base/en.locale\" , \"Items\" : { \"arab_buildings/desert2.biome#DisplayName\" : \"Desert\" , \"arab_buildings/palm_tree.plant#DisplayName\" : \"Palm tree\" , \"arab_buildings/arab_house1.house#DisplayName\" : \"House 1\" , \"arab_buildings/arab_house2.house#DisplayName\" : \"House 2\" , \"arab_buildings/arab_house3.house#DisplayName\" : \"House 3\" , \"arab_buildings/arab_house4.house#DisplayName\" : \"House 4\" , \"arab_buildings/arab_house5.house#DisplayName\" : \"House 5\" , \"arab_buildings/arab_obelisc_desert.house#DisplayName\" : \"Obelisk\" , \"arab_buildings/arab_store.house#DisplayName\" : \"Store\" , \"arab_buildings/arab_watertower.house#DisplayName\" : \"Water tower\" , } } The image shows that the indicated LocaleUri language is English and in the Items section the path of all the files of the different objects created is specified, in this case several buildings ( .house ), a biome ( .biome ) and a plant ( .plant ). You can have as many .strings files as languages you want to have in the mod. Publishing the mod \u00b6 Once you have finished modeling the building, configuring the different files and applying the color palette, all you have to do is create an image of the mod ( preview.png ) that will be shown in the mod finder and that must have dimensions of 184x110 pixels . It is also necessary to create a mod.json file where the description of the mod is specified and which in turn allows the mod to appear in the mod selection window when creating a new game. { \"Title\" : \"Adobe buildings V1.0\" , \"Description\" : \"This mod add new desert biome and 8 specific buildings for this biome.

To assign colors, we simply have to click on the different parts of the building that will be highlighted as we move the mouse over it and select a color in the window that appears on the right. To specify a specific color that we already have defined, you can enter the hexadecimal value of the color. The different bars that appear below the color picker allow you to add brightness to the material or not to be affected by light at night, making it have the effect of lighting. Once we have finished applying the colors, the building will look like this.

Introduction \u00b6 This guide tries to show you how to create a locomotive for use in Voxel Tycoon. In Voxel Tycoon you can create steam, diesel or electric locomotives, but in this guide we will focus on creating an electric locomotive. The guide is not intended to teach you modeling, so you must have a basic understanding of 3DS Max, Blender, Wings 3D, or any other program you want to use that allows you to import and export .obj files. Modeling suggestions \u00b6 As in all games, there are certain recommendations that must be followed when creating a 3d model. Apart from city buildings, trains and trucks are one of the most repeated assets in the game, and to avoid performance problems there are certain recommendations to follow. It's recommended that the body of the locomotive does not exceed 1500 triangles. The bogies and wheels should have a maximum of 1000 triangles since it's not as visible parts as the locomotive body. Make the necessary details so that the locomotive is recognizable but not overloaded. VT models are shorter than in real life. Depending on the type of locomotive you want to make, it's a good idea to import a model from the base game to compare the measurements and, in case of being an electric locomotive, have a reference of the height of the overhead wire for pantographs. Setting the model in the 3D modeling software \u00b6 Vehicles are made up of different parts. In the case of trains, they are usually made up of the body of the locomotive, bogies, and wheels. Steam locomotives also have several rods depending on their complexity. All the elements that make up a vehicle must have the coordinate axis in position 0,0,0 , as shown in the following image: While creating the model of the locomotive, we can place each part in place to verify that the proportions are correct, but when exporting the model, each part must be placed as in the previous image. Important The locomotive should be placed facing the front to the right (view left in the viewport in 3ds max. In other programs, the placement of the viewports may vary). Texturing the model is done in the same way as a building. For this, I recommend reading the guide Creating your first content mod . Exporting the locomotive \u00b6 Like any asset in VT, it must be exported in .obj format, and the files must be contained in Content/<mod_name> . It's recommended to create the same directory structure that uses the base game for convenience. Each part of the locomotive must be a single .obj file that will then be linked through the different configuration asset files that will be explained below. Axles setting ( .trainaxle asset) \u00b6 This file is used to define the wheels of the locomotive. There is no limit to the number of axles that a locomotive or bogie can use, and each one can be a different size as in steam locomotives. The file contains only two parameters: { \"MeshUri\" : \"spanish_pack/class1_axle.obj\" , \"WheelRadius\" : 0.185 } MeshUri : This parameter specifies the path where the axis .obj file is located. The first part of the path is the mod folder. WheelRadius : This parameter is the radius of the wheel that we can obtain from the 3d program. Bogie settings ( .trainbogie asset ) \u00b6 Locomotives may or may not have bogies in real life, but it must always be defined in the game. This is what the .trainbogie asset looks like: { \"MeshUri\" : \"spanish_pack/class269_bo.obj\" , \"AxleOffset\" : 0.113 , \"Axles\" : [ { \"Uri\" : \"spanish_pack/class269_axle.trainaxle\" , \"Offset\" : 0.316 }, { \"Uri\" : \"spanish_pack/class269_axle.trainaxle\" , \"Offset\" : -0.316 } ] } A bogie is made up of the mesh of the bogie itself and a section (axles) that define the type of axis and the position inside the bogie. A bogie can have from 1 to n specified axes. MeshUri : Specifies the path of the bogie mesh file. If the value is null, it means that the bogie has no mesh. Uri : Specifies the path of the axis .trainaxle file that we explained in the previous point. If the value is null, the wheel mesh will not appear. AxleOffet : Specify the axis position. Offset : Defines the axle position along the Z-axis of the bogie. A positive value means that it is the front wheel of the bogie and a negative value that is the rear wheel. Engine settings ( .trainunit asset ) \u00b6 This is the main file of the locomotive and where the rest of assets are linked. Many assets can be customized, including the sounds (which we will not explain in this guide). The .trainunit asset has several sections and parameters and looks like the following on an electric locomotive. Some sections are null, that means it hasn't been specified, or that this parameter is automatically calculated by the game. { \"Smokes\" : null , \"Bogies\" : [ { \"Uri\" : \"spanish_pack/class1_bo.trainbogie\" , \"Offset\" : 0.643 , \"Anchor1\" : true , \"Anchor2\" : false , \"Secondary\" : false }, { \"Uri\" : \"spanish_pack/class1_bo.trainbogie\" , \"Offset\" : -0.597 , \"Anchor1\" : false , \"Anchor2\" : true , \"Secondary\" : false } ], \"AudioUri\" : \"base/electric.trainaudio\" , \"Type\" : \"Electric\" , \"Length\" : null , \"VelocityLimit\" : 40.0 , \"Power\" : 160 , \"Weight\" : 30 , \"Price\" : null , \"PriceMultiplier\" : null , \"RunningCosts\" : null , \"RunningCostsMultiplier\" : null , \"Liveries\" : [ { \"MeshUri\" : \"spanish_pack/class1a.obj\" } ], \"Coupling1Uri\" : \"base/common.traincoupling\" , \"Coupling2Uri\" : \"base/common.traincoupling\" , \"Hidden\" : true , \"Submeshes\" : null , \"AnimationReferenceWheelRadius\" : null , \"ResearchUri\" : null , \"Explosive\" : false , \"ExplosionForce\" : null } Smoke : Specifies the position of the smoke in diesel and steam locomotives. Bogies (Array): Uri : Path of the .trainbogie asset. Anchor1 : Used to indicate the position of the bogie. For example, if the locomotive has 3 bogies, the values \u200b\u200bof Anchor1 and Anchor2 will be: true - false , false - false , false - true . Anchor2 : Used to indicate the position of the bogie. For example, if the locomotive has 2 bogies, the values \u200b\u200bof Anchor1 and Anchor2 will be: true - false , false - true . Offset : Bogie position respecting to the locomotive along the Z-axis. A positive value means it's the front bogie and a negative value the rear bogie. AudioUri : Path of the .trainaudio asset. Type : Locomotive type. Possible values: Steam, Diesel, Electric, Unpowered. Length : By default the value is null, the game automatically calculates the length of the locomotive using the boundingbox of the .obj file. When a value is specified, it is because we want the locomotive to overlap with another element as it happens with the semi-trailers of the trucks. VelocityLimit : Maximum locomotive speed specified in km / h. Power : Max engine power specified in Kw. Weight : Locomotive weight specified in Tonnes. Price : Locomotive cost. The default is null. The game calculates the price based on the power of the locomotive and economic fluctuations. PriceMultiplier : Locomotive cost price multiplier. By default is null. RunningCosts : Locomotive operating cost. By default is null. RunningCostsMultiplier : Locomotive operating cost multiplier. By default is null. Liveries (Array): MeshUri : Path of the .obj file of the locomotive body. Coupling1Uri : Path of the front locomotive .traincoupling asset. Coupling2Uri : Path of the rear locomotive .traincoupling asset. Note: Only cars with the same couplings could be coupled. Hidden : This parameter makes the locomotive not appear in the vehicle purchase menu. By default the value is false , but if the steam locomotive is articulated or requieres separate units (eg. Steam locomotive engine & tender, or fixed car suburban/subway set), this value will be true . Submeshes (Array): This section specifies the different meshes and animation parameters of the meshes of the rods of steam locomotives (see Animating locomotive rods guide). AnimationReferenceWheelRadius : Specifies the radius that the connecting rods will follow in the locomotives that have connecting rods. ResearchUri : If the locomotive needs to be researched in order to use it, this parameter indicates the path of the .research asset. Explosive : This parameter causes the locomotive or vehicle to explode in the event of an accident causing damage to the surrounding area. By default the value is false. ExplosionForce : Force of the explosion caused in the event of an accident if the explosive parameter is true . Setting it too high can cause the blast to damage the terrain so much that it destroys cities and entire resource deposits. Coupling setting ( .traincouplig asset) \u00b6 This asset allows defining a custom coupling for the locomotive that will make only locomotives and wagons that use the same coupling be able to be coupled. This asset does not contain any parameters, and the file is empty, but it must exist in order to function properly. Train recipe settings ( .trainrecipe asset) \u00b6 In the game we can define that locomotives or trains will form a consist that cannot be separated, or that multiple vehicles will be purchased at the same time - such as the steam locomotives that when we buy one in the game from the purchase menu from the depot, we buy the locomotive and the tender as a set. { \"Sections\" : [ { \"Count\" : null , \"MinCount\" : null , \"MaxCount\" : 1 , \"Units\" : [ { \"Uri\" : \"s_hst/hst1_eng_a.trainunit\" , \"Flipped\" : false } ] }, { \"Count\" : 0 , \"MinCount\" : 2 , \"MaxCount\" : 4 , \"Units\" : [ { \"Uri\" : \"s_hst/hst1_car.trainunit\" , \"Flipped\" : false } ] }, { \"Count\" : null , \"MinCount\" : null , \"MaxCount\" : 1 , \"Units\" : [ { \"Uri\" : \"s_hst/hst1_eng_b.trainunit\" , \"Flipped\" : true } ] } ], \"ResearchUri\" : null , \"Hidden\" : false } The file is divided into sections and you can indicate the number of minimum and maximum vehicles and what type a consist can have. In the file shown, it represents a consist of a train that contains a locomotive at the front, between 2 and 4 passenger cars and another locomotive at the rear. The parameters of this asset are quite explanatory. They indicate the minimum and maximum number of vehicles that make up the composition, what type they are (.trainunit asset) and whether they are inverted or not, such as the case of the rear locomotive. ResearchUri : If the consist or locomotive needs to be researched in order to use it, this parameter indicates the path of the .research asset. Hidden : This parameter makes the locomotive not appear in the vehicle purchase menu. By default the value is false, but if the steam locomotive is made up of the locomotive and the tender, this value will be true. Localization ( .strings asset) \u00b6 The .strings asset specifies the text that will be displayed in severals windows and menus in the game. { \"LocaleUri\" : \"base/en.locale\" , \"Items\" : { \"br_class05/steam_engine_6.trainunit#DisplayName\" : \"Br Class 05 Engine\" , \"br_class05/steam_engine_6_tender.trainunit#DisplayName\" : \"Br Class 05 Tender\" , \"br_class05/steam_engine_6.trainrecipe#DisplayName\" : \"Br Class 05\" } } In this example, it's show the text of the name of the locomotive and the tender as separate units and the train set as it appears in the purchase menu window. You can have as many .strings assets as languages you want in the same folder.

Introduction \u00b6 In this guide, we will see how to configure a truck with different types of loads and trailers. Basic knowledge of 3d design software is required as this guide will not cover the design part of the truck, only how to configure it to work properly in Voxel Tycoon. The following will explain each type of asset that a truck uses, how to configure the different cargo types, and how to configure trailers and semi-trailers. Prepare a model for export \u00b6 Trucks, like trains, have several parts that must be positioned on the coordinate axis at 0,0,0 and exported independently. To learn how to texture the model, read the Creating your first building guide where the process is explained in detail. This image shows the chassis position and both wheels, one single and one double. Important Like trains, trucks should also be facing the front to the right in the right viewport (Blender loads vehicles facing left), otherwise, the truck will appear in the wrong direction on the road. Once we have the chassis, and the wheels are textured and positioned correctly, we can explore each model in .obj format. Wheels ( .caraxle asset) \u00b6 All road vehicles must have a minimum of two axles, one for the front wheels and one for the rear. If the model we are making is a trailer or semi-trailer, the front axle must exist but it doesn't have to be a visible wheel. The .caraxle asset has only two parameters and is as shown below: { \"WheelMeshUri\" : \"scm_truck_pack/single_wheel.obj\" , \"WheelRadius\" : 0.162 } WheelMeshUri : Specifies the path of the wheel's .obj file. If we don't want it to have a mesh, this parameter will be null. WheelRadius : Specifies the radius of the wheel that we can obtain from the 3d program. This value is important because if it is greater the wheel will appear overlapping the road and if it is less, the wheel will float above the road. Truck configuration ( .carunit asset) \u00b6 The configuration of a truck is very similar to the configuration of a locomotive, only differing in the certain parameters specific to road vehicles vary. { \"Axles\" : [ { \"Uri\" : \"scm_truck_pack/single_wheel.caraxle\" , \"Offset\" : 0.545 , \"HalfTrack\" : 0.344 , \"Steered\" : true }, { \"Uri\" : \"scm_truck_pack/double_wheel.caraxle\" , \"Offset\" : -0.578 , \"HalfTrack\" : 0.278 , \"Steered\" : false } ], \"AudioUri\" : \"base/truck.caraudio\" , \"Type\" : \"Diesel\" , \"Length\" : null , \"VelocityLimit\" : 85.0 , \"Power\" : 170.0 , \"Weight\" : 4.2 , \"Price\" : null , \"PriceMultiplier\" : null , \"RunningCosts\" : null , \"RunningCostsMultiplier\" : null , \"Liveries\" : [ { \"MeshUri\" : \"scm_truck_pack/hopper_truck.obj\" } ], \"Coupling1Uri\" : null , \"Coupling2Uri\" : \"scm_truck_pack/scm_dolly_coupling.carcoupling\" , \"Hidden\" : false , \"Submeshes\" : null , \"AnimationReferenceWheelRadius\" : null , \"ResearchUri\" : \"scm_truck_pack/scm_trucks.research\" , \"Explosive\" : false , \"ExplosionForce\" : null } Axles (Array): Defines a list of vehicle axles. Uri : Path of the .caraxle asset. Offset : Axle position with respect to the center of the vehicle along the Z-axis. The front axle will have a positive value and the rear axle a negative value. HalfTrack : Wheel position with respect to the X-axis of the vehicle. Positive values are always indicated. The game automatically reverses the value to position the other wheel on the opposite side of the vehicle. Steered : Indicates whether the wheels on that axle are steered. Specifying vehicles with steered rear axles causes the rear wheels to not behave properly in curves and ramps. UriAudio : Path of the .caraudio asset. Type : Type of engine used by the vehicle. Possible values are Diesel, Gasoline, and Unpowered. Length : Vehicle length. By default the value is null but if it is a semi-trailer or trailer, the length must be specified because the semi-trailer has to overlap with the cab of the truck. The green rectangle indicates the length to be specified in the semitrailer length configuration. Like other vehicles, > semi-trailers should be centered on the coordinate axes using this length as a reference, not the total length of the semi-trailer. VelocityLimit : Vehicle max speed in km/h. Power : Maximum engine power of the vehicle in Kw. Weight : Vehicle weight in metric tons. Price : Price of the vehicle, by default the value is null , the game calculates the price based on the max power if powered and/or capacity. PriceMultiplier : Vehicle price multiplier. RunningCosts : Vehicle maintenance cost. RunningCostsMultiplier : Vehicle maintenance cost multiplier. Liveries (Array): MeshUri : Path of the mesh file (.obj) of the vehicle. Coupling1Uri , Coupling2Uri : Path of the .carcoupling asset . Trucks usually don't have couplings, the value of this parameter is null but if you want to put a semi-trailer or a dolly trailer, you must specify a front and/or rear couplings or both. Hidden : This parameter indicates whether or not the vehicle will be displayed in the vehicle purchase menu. A value true is usually set if the vehicle is made up of several parts and a .carrecipe asset has been created to display in the vehicle purchase window. ResearchUri : Path of the .research asset. Explosive : Determine if the transported cargo can explode. By default the value is false . ExplosionForce : Explosion force. By default the value is null . A very high value can cause a crater so large that it removes entire cities and industries from the map. Truck loads ( .capacities asset) \u00b6 This type of asset creates a load for items that are not visible, such as closed vans or trucks. For this reason, the Items array only shows the reference to the .item asset of each type of cargo. { \"Items\" : { \"base/advanced_furniture.item\" : null , \"base/advanced_wood_frame.item\" : null , ... \"base/vacuum_tube.item\" : null , \"base/wood_frame.item\" : null }, \"TargetUri\" : \"scm_truck_pack/box_trailer.carunit\" , \"MaxWeight\" : 20.0 , \"LoadingSpeedMultiplier\" : 1.0 , \"UnloadingSpeedMultiplier\" : 1.0 } Items (Array): List of pathes of the .item asset that the vehicle accepts. TargetURI : Path of the .carunit asset affected by the load. MaxWeight : Maximum capacity that the vehicle can load. The number of units depends on the weight of the loaded items. LoadingSpeedMultiplier : Vehicle load speed multiplier. By default, the value is 1.0 . UnloadingSpeedMultiplier : Vehicle unload speed multiplier. By default, the value is 1.0 . Truck loads ( .stackcapacity asset) \u00b6 This type of asset allows vehicles to have a stackable type load such as logs or planks. Compared to the capacities load type, this asset has more parameters regarding the size and position of the load. { \"Position\" : [ 0 , 0.431 , 0.228 ], \"Rotation\" : [ 0 , 0 , 0 ], \"SizeX\" : 0.685 , \"SizeZ\" : 1.3 , \"Items\" : { \"base/wood_log.item\" : { \"MeshUri\" : \"base/wood_log.obj\" , \"Resolution\" : { \"X\" : 3 , \"Y\" : 2 , \"Z\" : 1 }, \"Spacing\" : [ 0.02 , 0.02 , 0.03 ], \"Capacity\" : null , \"Explosive\" : false , \"ExplosionForce\" : null }, ... }, \"TargetUri\" : \"scm_truck_pack/hopper_trailer.carunit\" , \"MaxWeight\" : 22.0 , \"LoadingSpeedMultiplier\" : 1.0 , \"UnloadingSpeedMultiplier\" : 1.0 } Position : Position of the loading platform. The image shows the coordinate axis that represents the configured values. Rotation : Rotation of the load. The value will always be 0 on each axis. SizeX / SizeZ: Size of the loading platform that will determine the size of the items depending on the number of items that we want to stack. Items (Array): This array specifies each item that the vehicle can load. MeshUri : Path of the .obj file of the load item. Resolution : The resolution is a three-dimensional grid that indicates the number of items to be stacked along the indicated axis. Spacing : Separation between each item in the three axes (front/back - left-right - top-down). Capacity : Item carrying capacity. If the value is null, the maximum load of items will be calculated with the maximum load of the vehicle. Explosive : Determine if the transported cargo can explode. By default the value is false. ExplosionForce : Explosion force. By default the value is null. A very high value can cause a crater so large that it removes entire cities and industries from the map. Truck loads ( .heapcapacity asset) \u00b6 Heap-type loads are used for hopper-type vehicles to transport ores. This asset also adds animation parameters for loading and unloading the ore. In the following image, you can see the mesh of the coal heap. You can create a custom heap or use the model that comes with the base game but always set the parameters correctly. { \"Keyframes\" : { \"0\" : { \"Position\" : [ 0 , 0.466 , 0.416 ], \"Rotation\" : [ 0 , 0 , 0 ], \"SizeX\" : 0.0 , \"SizeZ\" : 0.0 , \"ScaleY\" : 0.0 }, \"0.2\" : { \"Position\" : [ 0 , 0.466 , 0.416 ], \"Rotation\" : [ 0 , 0 , 0 ], \"SizeX\" : 0.8 , \"SizeZ\" : 2.657 , \"ScaleY\" : 0.5 }, \"1\" : { \"Position\" : [ 0 , 0.541 , 0.416 ], \"Rotation\" : [ 0 , 0 , 0 ], \"SizeX\" : 0.8 , \"SizeZ\" : 2.657 , \"ScaleY\" : 1.0 } }, \"Items\" : { \"base/coal.item\" : { \"MeshUri\" : \"scm_truck_pack/coal_heap.obj\" , \"Capacity\" : null , \"Explosive\" : false , \"ExplosionForce\" : null } ... }, \"TargetUri\" : \"scm_truck_pack/hopper_semitrailer.carunit\" , \"MaxWeight\" : 32.0 , \"LoadingSpeedMultiplier\" : 1.0 , \"UnloadingSpeedMultiplier\" : 1.0 } Keyframes (Array): This array contains animation keyframes, 0.0 for when the vehicle is unloaded, some values for when it's partially loaded, and 1.0 one for when it is fully loaded. The value always goes from 0.0 to 1.0 regardless of the number of keyframes the load/unload animation has. The following parameters are self-explanatory, specifying the position, rotation, and mesh size of the load object. The rest of the parameters are the same as the rest of the assets explained above. Truck recipes ( .carrecipe asset): \u00b6 Like locomotives, trucks can form compositions like the case of trailers, which have a dolly trailer and trailer. Its setting are exactly the same as the train recipe because it's the same asset. For more information read the section Train recipe settings ( .trainrecipe asset) in the Creating your first locomotive mod guide. { \"Sections\" : [ { \"Count\" : null , \"MinCount\" : null , \"MaxCount\" : 1 , \"Units\" : [ { \"Uri\" : \"scm_truck_pack/dolly_trailer.carunit\" , \"Flipped\" : false }, { \"Uri\" : \"scm_truck_pack/box_trailer.carunit\" , \"Flipped\" : false } ] } ], \"ResearchUri\" : \"scm_truck_pack/scm_trucks.research\" , \"Hidden\" : false } Couplings ( .carcoupling asset ) \u00b6 Most of the trucks don't have couplings, but if it's a trailer or a semi-trailer it will have couplings at the front ( Coupling1Uri ), or if a cab at the rear ( Coupling2Uri ), or in both locations for dolly trailers.

Introduction \u00b6 This tutorial will guide you through the process of triggering an action whenever you click on a Notification. After finishing this tutorial, you will know how to: Create a class with the INotificationAction Interface Add an action to your Notifications Note This guide continues on Creating your first script mod . If you dont know how to setup the environment or how to get a mod in game, please follow this guide first. This guide is based on Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition Main Class \u00b6 Start a new project and call it \"NotificationActionExample\" . An unwritten rule in programming is that you give your variables, classes, methods, etc, clear names. They should be named in such a way so that you know what their function is when you read their name. As you might have noticed, when we created this project, the class inside the project is named \"Class1\" by default. namespace NotificationActionExample { public class Class1 { } } Obviously this is not a very clear name. Lets start with renaming Class1 and give it the name \"Main\" . The reason for this name is that usually the first class in your project will be your main class which manages and executes everything else. Of course you are free to call it whatever, it is not required to be named \"Main\" for the mod to work, just make sure the name represents the function of this class. To rename the class, right click on Class1 in your Solution Explorer and select Rename . Then type in \"Main\" and press enter. Note After you have pressed enter, you are asked if you want to perform a rename for all references, select Yes . Now we need to get access to callbacks which allows us to execute code at a certain point in the games lifecycle. To get access to these callbacks we need to inherit from the Mod -class. Where it says public class Main , change this to public class Main : Mod . The Mod -class gives us access to a couple of callbacks. For this example we are interested in the OnGameStarted() -callback. Inside your Main -class, add: protected override void OnGameStarted () { } Now we can set up our notification inside OnGameStarted() , just like in the \" Creating your first script mod \" guide. Lets add the following code to OnGameStarted() : //Priority is an optional argument when calling the NotificationManager NotificationPriority priority = NotificationPriority . Default ; //Color is an optional argument when calling the NotificationManager //Beware, using Color can cause a small issue, read note below Color color = Company . Current . Color ; string title = \"Notification Action\" ; string message = \"Click this notification to trigger a Notification Action\" ; //Lets use a bell as an icon FontIcon icon = FontIcon . FaSolid ( \"\\uf0f3\" ); Note Instead of using Color , string , etc, you can also use the var type. Personally Im not a fan of var , but you are free to use it if you prefer using var instead. Unfortunately using Color instead of var can cause a small issue in this example. When we added the variable type Color , the namespace System.Drawing was automatically added, since Color is part of this namespace. While Company.Current.Color does return a value of type Color , it is not part of the System.Drawing namespace, instead it belongs to the UnityEngine namespace. It is throwing an error because the value Company.Current.Color returns does not fit in System.Drawing.Color . There are 2 ways to fix this problem: Replace using System.Drawing; with using UnityEngine; If you can't replace/remove the System.Drawing namespace (because you might need it for something else), declare the color-variable like: UnityEngine.Color color = Company.Current.Color; NotificationManager.Current.Push() requires 6 arguments: Priority (Optional) Color (Optional) Title Message Action Icon We have set variables for all the arguments, except Action . Before we can create and set a variable for this argument, we have to create a new Class . NotificationAction Class \u00b6 Lets create a new Class . Right click on your project in your Solution Explorer , then go to Add > New Item... Then in the next window select Class and give it the name NotificationAction.cs and click Add . Once you have added this new class, follow the steps below: Implement the INotificationAction -interface. After you implemented the interface, your NotificationAction -class should now look like this: class NotificationAction : INotificationAction { public void Act () { throw new NotImplementedException (); } public void Read ( StateBinaryReader reader ) { throw new NotImplementedException (); } public void Write ( StateBinaryWriter writer ) { throw new NotImplementedException (); } } Help How to implement an interface? (Optional) Remove the throw new NotImplementedException(); from all 3 callbacks, to prevent any exceptions showing up in game. Lets add some code to the Act() -callback. This is the callback that will be triggered when you click on the linked notification. As an action we are going to show another notification that tells us that we succesfully triggered a notification action. Lets set up a new notification: //Priority is an optional parameter NotificationPriority priority = NotificationPriority . Default ; //For a color, lets use a somewhat darker green - Make sure you're using the Color32 type, read below Color32 color = new Color32 ( 63 , 191 , 63 , 255 ); string title = \"SUCCES!!!\" ; string message = \"You have succesfully triggered a notification action!\" ; //Lets use a thumbs up as an icon FontIcon icon = FontIcon . FaSolid ( \"\\uf164\" ); Note The Color32 -type accepts the full RGBA values (0 - 255), while the Color -type only accepts values from 0 to 1. When you have a RGB value you want to use, it is recommended to use the Color32 -type, else you have to convert your RGB values to a value between 0 and 1. This is not difficult to do, but it requires a bit of extra work which can be avoided. Then we need to call the Notification Manager to actually display this notification. We do this with adding the following statement: NotificationManager.Current.Push(priority, color, title, message, null, icon); Note INotificationAction action is a required argument while calling NotificationManager . Since we dont have an action we want to happen when this notification is clicked, we just pass null for this argument. As a final result your NotificationAction -class should now look like this: class NotificationAction : INotificationAction { public void Act () { //Priority is an optional parameter NotificationPriority priority = NotificationPriority . Default ; //Color is an optional parameter Color32 color = new Color32 ( 63 , 191 , 63 , 255 ); string title = \"SUCCES!!!\" ; string message = \"You have succesfully triggered a notification action!\" ; //Lets use a thumbs up as an icon FontIcon icon = FontIcon . FaSolid ( \"\\uf164\" ); NotificationManager . Current . Push ( priority , color , title , message , null , icon ); } public void Read ( StateBinaryReader reader ) { } public void Write ( StateBinaryWriter writer ) { } } Now that we have a class which can go in the INotificationAction action -variable, we can implement it. Implement the Notification Action \u00b6 Add the following line to your OnGameStarted() -callback in your Main -Class: INotificationAction action = new NotificationAction(); Your Main -class should now look like this: public class Main : Mod { public void OnGameStarted () { //Priority is an optional parameter NotificationPriority priority = NotificationPriority . Default ; //Color is an optional parameter Color color = Company . Current . Color ; string title = \"Notification Action\" ; string message = \"Click this notification to trigger a Notification Action\" ; //Lets use a bell as an icon FontIcon icon = FontIcon . FaSolid ( \"\\uf0f3\" ); INotificationAction action = new NotificationAction (); } } Now we have all the required arguments to call the Notification Manager . Add the following statement to your OnGameStarted -callback in your Main -Class: NotificationManager.Current.Push(priority, color, title, message, action, icon); As a final result your Main -class should look like this: public class Main : Mod { public void OnGameStarted () { //Priority is an optional parameter NotificationPriority priority = NotificationPriority . Default ; //Color is an optional parameter Color color = Company . Current . Color ; string title = \"Notification Action\" ; string message = \"Click this notification to trigger a Notification Action\" ; //Lets use a bell as an icon FontIcon icon = FontIcon . FaSolid ( \"\\uf0f3\" ); INotificationAction action = new NotificationAction (); NotificationManager . Current . Push ( priority , color , title , message , action , icon ); } } Compile and run the mod \u00b6 Now we can add this mod to the game and try it out. Tip To read in detail how to do this, check Run the mod section of the Creating your first script mod guide. Follow the steps below: Build your project into a .dll-file Locate your .dll-file and place it in /voxel-tycoon/content/<your_mod_folder> Create a mod.json file Start Voxel Tycoon and start a new game with your just created mod activated Wait for your game to load... CLICK THAT NOTIFICATION!!! Play around \u00b6 If you're not yet very familiar with coding, I suggest to play around some more to see what other awesome things you can do with Notification Actions . This is a good way to get better with coding.","title":"Adding an OnClick-event to a Notification"},{"location":"guides/script-mods/adding-onclick-event-to-a-notification/#adding-an-onclick-event-to-a-notification","text":"Info This guide is authored by Voxel Tycoon community member Nebruzias .","title":"Adding an OnClick-event to a Notification"},{"location":"guides/script-mods/adding-onclick-event-to-a-notification/#introduction","text":"This tutorial will guide you through the process of triggering an action whenever you click on a Notification.

This guide is based on Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"guides/script-mods/adding-onclick-event-to-a-notification/#main-class","text":"Start a new project and call it \"NotificationActionExample\" . An unwritten rule in programming is that you give your variables, classes, methods, etc, clear names. They should be named in such a way so that you know what their function is when you read their name. As you might have noticed, when we created this project, the class inside the project is named \"Class1\" by default. namespace NotificationActionExample { public class Class1 { } } Obviously this is not a very clear name. Lets start with renaming Class1 and give it the name \"Main\" . The reason for this name is that usually the first class in your project will be your main class which manages and executes everything else. Of course you are free to call it whatever, it is not required to be named \"Main\" for the mod to work, just make sure the name represents the function of this class. To rename the class, right click on Class1 in your Solution Explorer and select Rename . Then type in \"Main\" and press enter. Note After you have pressed enter, you are asked if you want to perform a rename for all references, select Yes . Now we need to get access to callbacks which allows us to execute code at a certain point in the games lifecycle. To get access to these callbacks we need to inherit from the Mod -class. Where it says public class Main , change this to public class Main : Mod . The Mod -class gives us access to a couple of callbacks. For this example we are interested in the OnGameStarted() -callback. Inside your Main -class, add: protected override void OnGameStarted () { } Now we can set up our notification inside OnGameStarted() , just like in the \" Creating your first script mod \" guide. Lets add the following code to OnGameStarted() : //Priority is an optional argument when calling the NotificationManager NotificationPriority priority = NotificationPriority . Default ; //Color is an optional argument when calling the NotificationManager //Beware, using Color can cause a small issue, read note below Color color = Company . Current . Color ; string title = \"Notification Action\" ; string message = \"Click this notification to trigger a Notification Action\" ; //Lets use a bell as an icon FontIcon icon = FontIcon . FaSolid ( \"\\uf0f3\" ); Note Instead of using Color , string , etc, you can also use the var type. Personally Im not a fan of var , but you are free to use it if you prefer using var instead. Unfortunately using Color instead of var can cause a small issue in this example. When we added the variable type Color , the namespace System.Drawing was automatically added, since Color is part of this namespace. While Company.Current.Color does return a value of type Color , it is not part of the System.Drawing namespace, instead it belongs to the UnityEngine namespace. It is throwing an error because the value Company.Current.Color returns does not fit in System.Drawing.Color . There are 2 ways to fix this problem: Replace using System.Drawing; with using UnityEngine; If you can't replace/remove the System.Drawing namespace (because you might need it for something else), declare the color-variable like: UnityEngine.Color color = Company.Current.Color; NotificationManager.Current.Push() requires 6 arguments: Priority (Optional) Color (Optional) Title Message Action Icon We have set variables for all the arguments, except Action .

This ranges from full-featured IDEs like Visual Studio, to manually calling the compiler on source files. In this tutorial, we will use Visual Studio (Community 2019) for this purpose, as the most straightforward way to build a .NET DLL on Windows. It can be obtained for free from the official site . Ensure that you have .NET Desktop development workload installed: Besides Visual Studio, you'll need - obviously - a licensed copy of Voxel Tycoon to test and publish your mods .
